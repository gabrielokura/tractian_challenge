# Mobile Challenge - TRACTIAN

### Improvements

- Search: Improve text search when the asset has other children (in some specific cases, the children are not displayed).
This can be resolved by implementing a cache of the tree after its initial population.

- Internationalization of all texts.

- Assets screen: a step could be added after the company selection to improve the efficiency of viewing all the data.
For example, selecting the region with its respective assets from a map. Even using the component tree, the visualization is not very intuitive. Starting from a prior selection, the app could present the user with data more aligned to the purpose of their search.

- Offline: After being sorted, the data could be saved on the device, allowing offline functionality and even faster loading speeds.
This feature would also require some synchronization mechanism to be devised.

## Demonstration video

The repository contains two videos demonstrating the application in action. One video shows it running on an Android device (Pixel 3a) and the other on an iPhone SE (third generation).
